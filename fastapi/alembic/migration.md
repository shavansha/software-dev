1. **Make changes to your SQLAlchemy model**:
   Modify your SQLAlchemy model (Python classes) to reflect the changes you want to make to your database schema. This might include adding new tables, columns, or relationships, modifying existing columns, or deleting tables or columns.

2. **Generate a new migration script with Alembic**:
   - Run the following command to automatically generate a new migration script based on the changes you made to your SQLAlchemy model:
     ```
     alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Brief description of changes"
     ```
     Replace `"Brief description of changes"` with a short description of the changes you made. This will help you identify the purpose of the migration script later.

3. **Review and customize the migration script (if necessary)**:
   The `alembic revision --autogenerate` command will generate a new migration script based on the changes it detects in your SQLAlchemy model. However, you should review the generated script to ensure it accurately captures the changes you made. You can also customize the script if needed, for example, to include additional operations or to modify the generated code.

4. **Apply the migration to your database**:
   After reviewing and customizing the migration script, you can apply the changes to your database by running the following command:

   `alembic upgrade head`

This command will apply any pending migrations and bring your database schema up to the latest version defined by the "head" of your migration history.

By following these steps, you can effectively manage changes to your SQLAlchemy models and keep your database schema in sync with your application code.
